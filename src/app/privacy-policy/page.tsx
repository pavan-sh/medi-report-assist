          <li>
            <strong>Temporary Storage:</strong> Data is temporarily stored only

        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl pt-4">4. GDPR Compliance</h2>
        <p>
          If you are located in the European Union (EU) or the European Economic
          Area (EEA), the <b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b>{" "}
          provides you with specific rights and protections regarding your
          personal data. We are committed to complying with GDPR requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal
          data:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request
            access to your personal data that we hold. Since we do not retain
            personal data after processing, we can only provide access to data
            within the session.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If you believe that the
            personal data we hold is inaccurate, you can request to correct it.
            This can be done while your session is still active.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):</strong> You have
            the right to request the deletion of your personal data. Since we do
            not retain personal data after the session ends, your data is
            automatically deleted once your session is complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Restriction of Processing:</strong> You have the
            right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal
            data if you believe it is inaccurate or if you believe that we are
            processing it unlawfully.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You can request a copy
            of the personal data we have collected from you in a structured,
            commonly used, and machine-readable format.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to
            the processing of your personal data. If we are processing your data
            for purposes other than providing you with the app’s services, you
            can object to this processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> If you have provided
            consent for us to process your data, you have the right to withdraw
            that consent at any time. You can withdraw consent by simply
            stopping the use of the app, and we will delete your data as per our
            data retention policy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Exercise Your GDPR Rights</h3>

          complaint with a supervisory authority in your country.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Encryption:</strong> All sensitive data, including personal
            and health information, is transmitted over encrypted channels

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Access Control:</strong> We restrict access to the data to
            authorized personnel only, and all information is deleted as soon as

          <li>
            <strong>Secure Deletion:</strong> Once the session is completed, all

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> If required by law or

          <li>
            <strong>Access:</strong> You can access the personal and health data
            you’ve entered into the app during your session. Since the data is
            not stored after the session ends, once it is deleted, it cannot be
            retrieved.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Correction:</strong> If you notice any inaccuracies in the

            session is still active.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deletion:</strong> As we do not retain any data after your
            session ends, there is no need to request deletion of your data, as
            it is automatically deleted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> If you no longer wish to
            provide your data, you can stop using the app at any time. Once you
